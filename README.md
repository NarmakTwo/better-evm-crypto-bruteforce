# EVM Crypto Brute Force
This script is designed to automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named wallets.txt.
